**SimulRPi** is a library that partly fakes
`RPi.GPIO <https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/>`_ and simulates some I/O devices
on a Raspberry Pi (RPi).

Introduction
============
In addition to partly faking `RPi.GPIO <https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/>`_,
**SimulRPi** also simulates these I/O devices connected to an RPi:

- push buttons by listening to pressed keyboard keys and
- LEDs by displaying small dots blinking on the terminal along with their GPIO \
  pin number.

When a LED is turned on, it is shown as a small red circle on the terminal. The
package `pynput`_ is used to monitor the
keyboard for any pressed key.

**Example: terminal output**

   <p><b>Simulating LEDs on an RPi via a terminal</b></p>
   </div>

Each circle represents a blinking LED connected to an RPi and the number
between brackets is the associated GPIO channel number. Here the "LED" on
channel 22 toggles between on and off when a key is pressed.

`:warning:`

   This library is not a Raspberry Pi emulator nor a complete mock-up of
   `RPi.GPIO`_, only the most important functions that I needed for my
   `Darth-Vader-RPi`_ project were added.

   If there is enough interest in this library, I will eventually mock more
   functions from `RPi.GPIO`_. Thus,
   `let me know through SimulRPi's issues page`_ if you want me to add more
   things to this library.

Dependencies
============
* **Platforms:** macOS, Linux
* **Python**: 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
* ``pynput`` >=1.6.8: for monitoring the keyboard for any pressed key

Installation instructions
=========================
1. Install the ``SimulRPi`` package with *pip*::

   $ pip install SimulRPi

   It will install the dependency ``pynput`` if it is not already found in your system.

2. Test your installation by importing ``SimulRPi`` and printing its version::

   $ python -c "import SimulRPi; print(SimulRPi.__version__)"

Usage
=====
Use the library in your own code
--------------------------------
Case 1: with a ``try`` and ``except`` blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can try importing ``RPi.GPIO`` first and if it is not found, then fallback
on the module ``SimulRPi.GPIO``.

..
   IMPORTANT:
   GitHub and PyPI don't recognize `:mod:`
   Also they don't recognize :caption: (used in code-block)

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   except ImportError:
       import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   # Rest of your code

The code from the previous example would be put at the beginning of your file
with the other imports.

Case 2: with a simulation flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Or maybe you have a flag to tell whether you want to work with the simulation
module or the real one.

.. code-block:: python

   if simulation:
       import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO
   else:
       import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

   # Rest of your code

Script ``run_examples.py``
--------------------------
The script `run_examples`_ which you have access to once you
install
the ``SimulRPi`` package allows you to run different code examples on your RPi
or computer. If it is run on your computer, it will make use of the module
``SimulRPi.GPIO``
which partly fakes `RPi.GPIO`_.

The different code examples are those presented in
**Examples**
and show the capability of ``SimulRPi.GPIO`` for simulating I/O devices on an
RPi such as push buttons and LEDS.

Here is a list of the functions associated with each code example:
   - Example 1: `ex1_turn_on_led() <https://simulrpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#run_examples.ex1_turn_on_led>`_
   - Example 2: `ex2_turn_on_many_leds() <https://simulrpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#run_examples.ex2_turn_on_many_leds>`_
   - Example 3: `ex3_detect_button() <https://simulrpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#run_examples.ex3_detect_button>`_
   - Example 4: `ex4_blink_led() <https://simulrpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#run_examples.ex4_blink_led>`_
   - Example 5: `ex5_blink_led_if_button() <https://simulrpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#run_examples.ex5_blink_led_if_button>`_

List of options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To display the script's list of options and their descriptions:
``run_examples -h``

   -e       The number of the code example you want to run. It is required.
            (default: None)
   -m       Set the numbering system used to identify the I/O pins on an RPi.
            (default: BCM)
   -s       Enable simulation mode, i.e. ``SimulRPi.GPIO`` wil be use for
            simulating ``RPi.GPIO``. (default: False)
   -l       The GPIO channels to be used for LEDs. If an example only requires
            1 channel, the first channel from the provided list will be used.
            (default: [10, 11, 12])
   -b       The GPIO channel to be used for a push button. The default value is
            channel 20 which is associated with the keyboard key *alt_r*.
            (default: 13)
   -t       Total time in seconds LEDs will be blinking. (default: 4)
   -k       The name of the key associated with the button channel. The name
            must be one of those recognized by the module *pynput*. See the
            *SimulRPi* documentation for a list of valid key names:
            https://bit.ly/2Pw1OBe. Example: *alt*, *cmd_r* (default: *alt_r*)
   --on     Time in seconds the LED will stay turned ON at a time. (default: 1)
   --off    Time in seconds the LED will stay turned OFF at a time. (default: 1)

How to run the script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you install the package ``SimulRPi``
, you should have access to the script ``run_examples`` which can be called
from the terminal by providing some arguments.

For example: ``run_examples -e 1 -s``.

Let's run the code example **# 5** which blinks a LED if a specified key is
pressed.

Here is the command line for blinking a LED (on channel 21) for a total of 5
seconds if the key ``cmd_r`` is pressed when the simulation package
``SimulRPi`` is used::

   $ run_examples -s -e 5 -l 21 -t 5 -k cmd_r

`:star:`

   Don't forget the flag *-s* (for simulation) when running the script
   ``run_examples`` if you want to run a code example on your computer, and
   not on your RPi.

.. _examples-label:

Examples
========
The examples presented thereafter will show you how to use ``SimulRPi`` to
simulate LEDs and push buttons.

The code for the examples shown here can be also found as a script in
`run_examples`_.

`:information_source:`

   Since we are showing how to use the ``SimulRPi`` library, the presented code
   examples are to be executed on your computer. However, the script
   `run_examples`_
   which runs the following code examples can be executed on a Raspberry Pi or
   your computer.

Example 1: display 1 LED
------------------------
**Example 1** consists in displaying one LED on the GPIO channel 11. Here is
the code along with the output from the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   led_channel = 11
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(led_channel, GPIO.OUT)
   GPIO.output(led_channel, GPIO.HIGH)
   GPIO.cleanup()

**Output:**

   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/SimulRPi/master/docs/_static/images/example_01_terminal_output.png
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 01: terminal output

|

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 1 with the script
``run_examples`` is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 1 -l 11

`:warning:`

   Always call `GPIO.cleanup() <https://simulrpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#GPIO.cleanup>`_
   at the end of your program to free up any resources such as stopping threads.

Example 2: display 3 LEDs
-------------------------
**Example 2** consists in displaying three LEDs on channels 10, 11, and 12,
respectively. Here is the code along with the output from the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   led_channels = [10, 11, 12]
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   for ch in led_channels:
       GPIO.setup(ch, GPIO.OUT)
       GPIO.output(ch, GPIO.HIGH)
   GPIO.cleanup()

**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/SimulRPi/master/docs/_static/images/example_02_terminal_output.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/SimulRPi/master/docs/_static/images/example_02_terminal_output.png
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 02: terminal output

|

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 2 with the script
``run_examples`` is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 2

Example 3: detect a pressed key
-------------------------------
**Example 3** consists in detecting if the key ``cmd_r`` is pressed and then
printing a message. Here is the code along with the output from the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   channel = 17
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(channel, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
   print("Press key 'cmd_r' to exit")
   while True:
       if not GPIO.input(channel):
           print("Key 'cmd_r' pressed")
           break
   GPIO.cleanup()


**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/SimulRPi/master/docs/_static/images/example_03_terminal_output.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/SimulRPi/master/docs/_static/images/example_03_terminal_output.png
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 03: terminal output

|

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 3 with the script
``run_examples`` is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 3 -k cmd_r

`:information_source:`

   By default, ``SimulRPi`` maps the key ``cmd_r`` to channel 17 as can be
   seen from the `default key-to-channel map
   <https://github.com/raul23/SimulRPi/blob/master/SimulRPi/default_keymap.py#L19>`_.

   See also the documentation for `SimulRPi.mapping <https://simulrpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#module-SimulRPi.mapping>`_
   where the default keymap is defined.

Example 4: blink a LED
----------------------
**Example 4** consists in blinking a LED on channel 20 for 4 seconds (or until
you press ``ctrl`` + ``c``). Here is the code along with the output from
the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import time
   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   channel = 20
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(channel, GPIO.OUT)
   start = time.time()
   while (time.time() - start) < 4:
       try:
           GPIO.output(channel, GPIO.HIGH)
           time.sleep(0.5)
           GPIO.output(channel, GPIO.LOW)
           time.sleep(0.5)
       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           break
   GPIO.cleanup()

**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/SimulRPi/master/docs/_static/images/example_04_terminal_output.gif
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/SimulRPi/master/docs/_static/images/example_04_terminal_output.gif
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 04: terminal output


The command line for reproducing the same results for example 4 with the script
``run_examples`` is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 4 -t 4 -l 20

Example 5: blink a LED if a key is pressed
------------------------------------------
**Example 5** consists in blinking a LED on channel 10 for 3 seconds if the key
``ctrl_r`` is pressed. And then, exiting from the program. The program can
also be terminated at any time by pressing ``ctrl`` + ``c``. Here is the
code along with the output from the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import time
   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   led_channel = 10
   key_channel = 20
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(led_channel, GPIO.OUT)
   GPIO.setup(key_channel, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
   print("Press key 'ctrl_r' to blink a LED")
   while True:
       try:
           if not GPIO.input(key_channel):
               print("Key 'ctrl_r' pressed")
               start = time.time()
               while (time.time() - start) < 3:
                   GPIO.output(led_channel, GPIO.HIGH)
                   time.sleep(0.5)
                   GPIO.output(led_channel, GPIO.LOW)
                   time.sleep(0.5)
               break
       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           break
   GPIO.cleanup()

**Output:**

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 5 with the script
``run_examples`` is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 5 -t 3 -k ctrl_r

`:information_source:`

   By default, ``SimulRPi`` maps the key ``ctrl_r`` to channel 20 as can be
   from the `default key-to-channel map
   <https://github.com/raul23/SimulRPi/blob/master/SimulRPi/default_keymap.py#L22>`__.

   See also the documentation for `SimulRPi.mapping <https://simulrpi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html#module-SimulRPi.mapping>`_
   where the default keymap is defined.

Change Log
==========
0.0.0a
------
* First version
* Tested `code examples`_ on different platforms and here are the results:
   * On an RPi with ``RPi.GPIO``: all examples involving LEDs and pressing
     buttons worked
   * On a computer with ``SimulRPi.GPIO``:
      * macOS: all examples involving "LEDs" and keyboard keys worked
      * RPi OS [Debian-based]: all examples involving only "LEDs" worked

        **NOTE:** I was running the script `run_examples`_
        with ``ssh`` but ``pynput`` doesn't detect any pressed keyboard keys
        even though I set my environment variable ``Display``, added
        ``PYTHONPATH`` to *etc/sudoers* and ran the script with ``sudo``. To be
        further investigated.

TODOs
=====
* Write unit tests. **High priority**
   * Remove ``pynput`` from *requirements_travis.txt*: this entails adding the
     case to ``SimulRPi.GPIO`` when ``pynput`` is not found about not
     creating the listener thread that monitors the keyboard and ignoring all
     parts of the ``SimulRPi.GPIO`` where the listener thread is being accessed
     (e.g. for starting it).
* Run code examples involving pressing keyboard keys directly on an RPi (no
  ``ssh``) and post results. **High priority**
* In `run_examples`_, improve timer accuracy when waiting for a LED to stop
  blinking or for a function to stop displaying a LED. **Medium priority**
* Investigate further why no keyboard keys could be detected when connecting to
  an RPi through ``ssh`` and running the script `run_examples`_ with ``sudo``.
  **Low priority**

Resources
=========
* `SimulRPi documentation`_
* `SimulRPi PyPI`_
* `Darth-Vader-RPi`_: personal project using ``RPi.GPIO`` for activating a Darth
  Vader action figure with light and sounds and ``SimulRPi.GPIO`` as fallback if
  testing on a computer when no RPi available

References
==========
* `pynput`_: package used for monitoring the keyboard for any pressed keys as to
  simulate push buttons connected to an RPi
