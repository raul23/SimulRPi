"""Module that partly fakes `RPi.GPIO`_ and simulates some I/O devices.

It simulates these I/O devices connected to a Raspberry Pi:

    - push buttons by listening to pressed keyboard keys and
    - LEDs by displaying red dots blinking in the terminal along with
      their GPIO channel number.

When a LED is turned on, it is shown as a red dot in the terminal. The
`pynput`_ package is used to monitor the keyboard for any pressed key.

.. TODO: also found in README_docs.rst

**Example: terminal output** ::

    â¬¤ [9]   â¬¤ [10]   ðŸ”´ [11]

.. highlight:: python

where each dot represents a LED and the number between brackets is the
associated GPIO channel number.

.. important::

    This library is not a Raspberry Pi emulator nor a complete mock-up of
    `RPi.GPIO`_, only the most important functions that I needed for my
    `Darth-Vader-RPi project`_ were added.

    If there is enough interest in this library, I will eventually mock more
    functions from `RPi.GPIO`_.
