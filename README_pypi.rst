**SimulRPi** is a library that partly fakes
`RPi.GPIO`_ and simulates some I/O devices
on a Raspberry Pi (RPi).

**Example:** simulating LEDs connected to an RPi via a terminal

Introduction
============
In addition to partly faking `RPi.GPIO <https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/>`_,
**SimulRPi** also simulates these I/O devices connected to an RPi:

- push buttons by listening to pressed keyboard keys and
- LEDs by blinking dots in the terminal along with their GPIO pin
  numbers.

When a LED is turned on, it is shown as a red dot in the terminal. The
`pynput`_ package is used to monitor the keyboard for any pressed key.

**Example: terminal output**

   :align: center
   :alt: Simulating LEDs on an RPi via a terminal

Each dot represents a blinking LED connected to an RPi and the number
between brackets is the associated GPIO channel number. Here the LED on
channel 22 toggles between on and off when a key is pressed.

Also, the color of the LEDs can be customized as you can see here where the LED
on channel 22 is colored differently from the others.

**Important**

   This library is not a Raspberry Pi emulator nor a complete mock-up of
   `RPi.GPIO`_, only the most important functions that I needed for my
   `Darth-Vader-RPi`_ project were added.

   If there is enough interest in this library, I will eventually mock more
   functions from `RPi.GPIO`_.

Dependencies
============
* **Platforms:** macOS, Linux
* **Python**: 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8
* ``pynput`` >=1.6.8: for monitoring the keyboard for any pressed key

.. _installation-instructions-label:

Installation instructions ðŸ˜Ž
============================

1. Make sure to update *pip*::

   $ pip install --upgrade pip

2. Install the package ``SimulRPi`` with *pip*::

   $ pip install SimulRPi

   It will install the dependency ``pynput`` if it is not already found in your
   system.

**Important**

   Make sure that *pip* is working with the correct Python version. It might be
   the case that *pip* is using Python 2.x You can find what Python version
   *pip* uses with the following::

      $ pip -V

   If *pip* is working with the wrong Python version, then try to use *pip3*
   which works with Python 3.x

**Note**

   To install the **bleeding-edge version** of the ``SimulRPi`` package,
   install it from its github repository::

      $ pip install git+https://github.com/raul23/SimulRPi#egg=SimulRPi

   However, this latest version is not as stable as the one from
   PyPI but you get the latest features being implemented.

**Warning message**

If you get the warning message from *pip* that the ``run_examples`` script
is not defined in your *PATH*::

   WARNING: The script run_examples is installed in '/home/pi/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.

Add the directory mentioned in the warning to your *PATH* by editing your
configuration file (e.g. *.bashrc*). See this `article`_ on how to set *PATH*
on Linux and macOS.

**Test installation**

Test your installation by importing ``SimulRPi`` and printing its version::

   $ python -c "import SimulRPi; print(SimulRPi.__version__)"

Usage
=====
Use the library in your own code
--------------------------------
Case 1: with a ``try`` and ``except`` blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can try importing ``RPi.GPIO`` first and if it is not found, then fallback
on the ``SimulRPi.GPIO`` module.

..
   IMPORTANT:
   GitHub and PyPI don't recognize `:mod:`
   Also they don't recognize :caption: (used in code-block)

.. code-block:: python

   try:
       import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   except ImportError:
       import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   # Rest of your code

The code from the previous example would be put at the beginning of your file
with the other imports.

Case 2: with a simulation flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Or maybe you have a flag to tell whether you want to work with the simulation
module or the real one.

.. code-block:: python

   if simulation:
       import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO
   else:
       import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

   # Rest of your code

Script ``run_examples``
--------------------------
The `run_examples`_ script which you have access to once you install
the ``SimulRPi`` package allows you to run different code examples on your RPi
or computer. If it is run on your computer, it will make use of the
``SimulRPi.GPIO`` module which partly fakes ``RPi.GPIO``.

The different code examples are those presented in **Examples** and show the
capability of ``SimulRPi.GPIO`` for simulating I/O devices on an RPi such as
push buttons and LEDs.

Here is a list of the functions that implement each code example:
   - Example 1: `ex1_turn_on_led()`_
   - Example 2: `ex2_turn_on_many_leds()`_
   - Example 3: `ex3_detect_button()`_
   - Example 4: `ex4_blink_led()`_
   - Example 5: `ex5_blink_led_if_button()`_

List of options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To display the script's list of options and their descriptions::

   $ run_examples -h

-e       The number of the code example you want to run. It is required.
         (default: None)
-m       Set the numbering system (BCM or BOARD) used to identify the I/O pins
         on an RPi. (default: BCM)
-s       Enable simulation mode, i.e. ``SimulRPi.GPIO`` will be used for
         simulating ``RPi.GPIO``. (default: False)
-l       The channel numbers to be used for LEDs. If an example only
         requires 1 channel, the first channel from the provided list will
         be used. (default: [9, 10, 11])
-b       The channel number to be used for a push button. The default value
         is channel 17 which is associated by default with the keyboard key
         *cmd_r*. (default: 17)
-k       The name of the key associated with the button channel. The name
         must be one of those recognized by the *pynput* package. See the
         *SimulRPi* documentation for a list of valid key names:
         https://bit.ly/2Pw1OBe. Example: *alt*, *ctrl_r* (default: *cmd_r*)
-t       Total time in seconds the LEDs will be blinking. (default: 4)
--on     Time in seconds the LEDs will stay turned ON at a time. (default: 1)
--off    Time in seconds the LEDs will stay turned OFF at a time. (default: 1)
-a       Use ASCII-based LED symbols. Useful if you are having problems
         displaying the default LED signs that make use of special characters.
         However, it is recommended to fix your display problems which might be
         caused by locale settings not set correctly. Check the article
         'Display problems' @ https://bit.ly/35B8bfs for more info about
         solutions to display problems (default: False)

How to run the script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you install the ``SimulRPi`` package, you should have access to the
``run_examples`` script which can be called from the terminal by providing some
arguments.

For example::

   $ run_examples -e 1 -s

Let's run the code example 5 which blinks a LED if a specified key is
pressed::

   $ run_examples -s -e 5 -l 22 -t 5 -k ctrl_r

Explanation of the previous command-line:

- ``-s``: we run the code example as a **simulation**, i.e. on our computer
  instead of an RPi
- ``-e 5``: we run code example **5** which blinks a LED if a key is pressed
- ``-l 22``: we blink a LED on channel **22**
- ``-t 5``: we blink a LED for a total of **5** seconds
- ``-k ctrl_r``: a LED is blinked if the key ``ctrl_r`` is pressed

**Output:**

**Important**

   Don't forget the *-s* flag when running the ``run_examples`` script as simulation,
   if you want to run a code example on your computer, and not on your RPi.

.. _examples-label:

Examples
========
The examples presented thereafter will show you how to use ``SimulRPi`` to
simulate LEDs and push buttons.

The code for the examples shown here can be also found as a script in
`run_examples`_.

**Note**

   Since we are showing how to use the ``SimulRPi`` library, the presented code
   examples are to be executed on your computer. However, the
   ``run_examples`` script which runs the following code examples can be executed on a
   Raspberry Pi or your computer.

Example 1: display 1 LED
------------------------
**Example 1** consists in displaying one LED on the GPIO channel 10. Here is
the code along with the output from the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   led_channel = 10
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(led_channel, GPIO.OUT)
   GPIO.output(led_channel, GPIO.HIGH)
   GPIO.cleanup()

**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_01_terminal_output.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_01_terminal_output.png
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 01: terminal output

|
|
|

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 1 with the
``run_examples`` script is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 1 -l 10

**Warning**

   Always call `GPIO.cleanup()`_ at the end of your program to free up any
   resources such as stopping threads.

Example 2: display 3 LEDs
-------------------------
**Example 2** consists in displaying three LEDs on channels 9, 10, and 11,
respectively. Here is the code along with the output from the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   led_channels = [9, 10, 11]
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(led_channels, GPIO.OUT)
   GPIO.output(led_channels, GPIO.HIGH)
   GPIO.cleanup()

**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_02_terminal_output.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_02_terminal_output.png
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 02: terminal output

|
|

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 2 with the
``run_examples`` script is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 2

**Note**

   In example 2, we could have also used a ``for`` loop to setup the output
   channels and set their states (but more cumbersome):

   .. code-block:: python

      import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

      led_channels = [9, 10, 11]
      GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
      for ch in led_channels:
          GPIO.setup(ch, GPIO.OUT)
          GPIO.output(ch, GPIO.HIGH)
      GPIO.cleanup()

   The `GPIO.setup()`_ function accepts channel numbers as ``int``, ``list``,
   and ``tuple``. Same with the `GPIO.output()`_ function which also accepts
   channel numbers and output states as ``int``, ``list``, and ``tuple``.

Example 3: detect a pressed key
-------------------------------
**Example 3** consists in detecting if the key ``cmd_r`` is pressed and then
printing a message. Here is the code along with the output from the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   channel = 17
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(channel, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
   print("Press key 'cmd_r' to exit\n")
   while True:
       if not GPIO.input(channel):
           print("Key pressed!")
           break
   GPIO.cleanup()


**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_03_terminal_output.png
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_03_terminal_output.png
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 03: terminal output

|
|
|

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 3 with the
``run_examples`` script is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 3 -k cmd_r

**Note**

   By default, ``SimulRPi`` maps the key ``cmd_r`` to channel 17 as can be
   seen from the `default key-to-channel map <https://github.com/raul23/archive/blob/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/default_keymap.py#L19>`__.

   See also the documentation for `SimulRPi.mapping`_ where the default keymap
   is defined.

Example 4: blink a LED
----------------------
**Example 4** consists in blinking a LED on channel 22 for 4 seconds (or until
you press ``ctrl`` + ``c``). Here is the code along with the output from
the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import time
   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   channel = 22
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(channel, GPIO.OUT)
   start = time.time()
   print("Ex 4: blink a LED for 4.0 seconds\n")
   while (time.time() - start) < 4:
       try:
           GPIO.output(channel, GPIO.HIGH)
           time.sleep(0.5)
           GPIO.output(channel, GPIO.LOW)
           time.sleep(0.5)
       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           break
   GPIO.cleanup()

**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_04_terminal_output.gif
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_04_terminal_output.gif
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 04: terminal output

|
|
|
|

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 4 with the
``run_examples`` script is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 4 -t 4 -l 22

Example 5: blink a LED if a key is pressed
------------------------------------------
**Example 5** consists in blinking a LED on channel 10 for 3 seconds if the key
``shift_r`` is pressed. And then exiting from the program. The program can
also be terminated at anytime by pressing ``ctrl`` + ``c``. Here is the code
along with the output from the terminal:

.. code-block:: python

   import time
   import SimulRPi.GPIO as GPIO

   led_channel = 10
   key_channel = 27
   GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
   GPIO.setup(led_channel, GPIO.OUT)
   GPIO.setup(key_channel, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
   print("Press the key 'shift_r' to turn on light ...\n")
   while True:
       try:
           if not GPIO.input(key_channel):
               print("The key 'shift_r' was pressed!")
               start = time.time()
               while (time.time() - start) < 3:
                   GPIO.output(led_channel, GPIO.HIGH)
                   time.sleep(0.5)
                   GPIO.output(led_channel, GPIO.LOW)
                   time.sleep(0.5)
               break
       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           break
   GPIO.cleanup()

**Output:**

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_05_terminal_output.gif
   :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raul23/images/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/example_05_terminal_output.gif
   :align: left
   :alt: Example 05: terminal output

|
|

The command line for reproducing the same results for example 5 with the
``run_examples`` script is the following::

   $ run_examples -s -e 5 -t 3 -l 10 -b 27

**Note**

   By default, ``SimulRPi`` maps the key ``shift_r`` to channel 27 as can be
   seen from the `default key-to-channel map <https://github.com/raul23/archive/blob/master/SimulRPi/v0.1.0a0/default_keymap.py#L29>`__.

   See also the documentation for `SimulRPi.mapping`_ where the default keymap
   is defined.
