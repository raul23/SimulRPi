Version 0.1.0a0
===============
.. _default-led-symbols-label:

.. TODO: IMPORTANT add date

**September 8, 2020**

* The default LED symbols are now big non-ASCII signs::

   ðŸ›‘ : LED turned ON
   âšª : LED turned OFF

  **NOTE:** the default symbols used by all GPIO channels can be modified with
  :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.setdefaultsymbols`

* LED symbols for each channel can be modified with
  :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.setsymbols`
* Channel names can now be displayed instead of channel numbers in the terminal::

   ðŸ›‘  [LED 1]        ðŸ›‘  [LED 2]        ðŸ›‘  [LED 3]        â¬¤  [lightsaber]
* New attributes:

  * ``SimulRPi.Pin.channel_id``: unique identifier
  * ``SimulRPi.Pin.channel_name``: displayed in the terminal along each LED
    symbol
  * ``SimulRPi.Pin.channel_number``: used to be called ``channel``
  * ``SimulRPi.Pin.channel_type``: used to be called ``gpio_function`` and
    refers to the type of GPIO channel, e.g. 1 (`GPIO.IN`) or 0 (`GPIO.OUT`).
  * ``SimulRPi.Pin.led_symbols``: each pin (aka channel) is represented by a
    LED symbol if it is an output channel
  * ``SimulRPi.Manager.default_led_symbols``: by default these are the
    `LED symbols`_ used to represent each GPIO channel in the terminal

* New functions:

  * :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.setchannelnames`: set channels names for multiple
    channels
  * :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.setchannels`: set the attributes (e.g.
    ``channel_name`` and ``led_symbols``) for multiple channels
  * :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.setdefaultsymbols`: change the default LED symbols
  * :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.setsymbols`: set the LED symbols for multiple channels
  * :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.wait`: waits for the threads to do their tasks and
    raises an exception if there was an error in a thread's target function.
    Hence, the main program can catch these thread exceptions.

* The displaying thread is now an instance of
  :class:`SimulRPi.GPIO.ExceptionThread`. Thus, if there is an exception raised
  in :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.Manager.display_leds()`, it is now possible to catch
  it in a main thread

* The keyboard listener thread is now an instance of
  ``SimulRPi.GPIO.KeyboardExceptionThread`` (a subclass of
  :class:`pynput.keyboard.Listener`). Thus, if there is an exception raised in
  :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.Manager.on_press` or
  :meth:`SimulRPi.GPIO.Manager.on_release`, it is now possible to catch it in a
  main thread

* :mod:`SimulRPi.run_examples`: all simulation-based examples involving "LEDs"
  and pressing keyboard keys worked on the RPi OS (Debian-based)

.. note::

  These lists are not exhaustive, only the most important attributes and
  functions are mentionned. See the `API reference`_ for more info.

Version 0.0.1a0
===============

**August 14, 2020**

* In ``SimulRPi.GPIO``, the package ``pynput`` is not required anymore. If it
  is not found, all keyboard-related functionalities from the ``SimulRPi``
  library will be skipped. Thus, no keyboard keys will be detected if pressed
  or released when ``pynput`` is not installed.

  This was necessary because *Travis* was raising an exception when I was
  running a unit test: `Xlib.error.DisplayNameError`_. It was
  due to ``pynput`` not working well in a headless setup. Thus, ``pynput`` is
  now removed from *requirements_travis.txt*.

  Eventually, I will mock ``pynput`` when doing unit tests on parts of the
  library that make use of ``pynput``.

* Started writing unit tests

Version 0.0.0a0
===============

**August 9, 2020**

* First version

* Tested `code examples`_ on different platforms and here are the results

  * On an RPi with ``RPi.GPIO``: all examples involving LEDs and pressing
    buttons worked

  * On a computer with ``SimulRPi.GPIO``

    * macOS: all examples involving "LEDs" and keyboard keys worked
    * RPi OS [Debian-based]: all examples involving "LEDs" only worked

      **NOTE:** I was running the script :mod:`~SimulRPi.run_examples`
      with ``ssh`` but ``pynput`` doesn't detect any pressed keyboard key
      even though I set my environment variable ``Display``, added
      ``PYTHONPATH`` to *etc/sudoers* and ran the script with ``sudo``. To be
      further investigated.

[*EDIT:* tested the code examples with :mod:`~SimulRPi.run_examples`]
