**SimulRPi** is a library that partly fakes
`RPi.GPIO <https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/>`_ and simulates some I/O devices
on a Raspberry Pi (RPi).

   <p><b>Simulating LEDs on an RPi via a terminal</b></p>
   </div>

Each circle represents a blinking LED connected to an RPi and the number
between brackets is the associated GPIO channel number. Here the "LED" on
channel 22 toggles between on and off when a key is pressed.

See the `README <README_docs.html>`_ for more info about the library.
